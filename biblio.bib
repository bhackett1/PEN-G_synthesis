To improve the analysis of results from the C-S detector digital pulse shape analysis techniques have been used to eliminate neutron recoil artifacts in the recorded data. Data was collected using a 8-GHz, 10-bit waveform digitizer with its full scale corresponding to approximately 6-MeV neutrons. The measurements were made with the detector axis perpendicular to the direction of ions in the ENG in a plane 0.5-m to the side of the ENG, measuring neutrons emitted at an angle from 87.3? to 92.7? with respect to the path of ions in the ENG. The system demonstrated an energy resolution of approximately 0.040 MeV for the thermal peak and approximately 0.13 MeV at the DD neutron energy. In order to achieve the ultimate resolution capable with this type of detector it is clear that a higher-precision digitizer will be needed.},

abstract = {The absolute differential efficiency of a 4.60- × 4.65-cm-dia. liquid organic scintillator, NE-213, was determined for nearly monoenergetic neutrons at 20 energies between 0.2 and 22 MeV incident on the curved side of the detector. These calibrations are shown to apply to an NE-211 scintillator as well. A 5-MeV Van de Graaff generator provided 2-nsec pulses of neutrons by means of T(p,n)3He, D(d,n)3He (gas target), and T(d,n)4He reactions. With the aid of time-of-flight techniques and pulse-shape discrimination to eliminate spurious neutron and gamma-ray events, reliable pulse-height spectra were obtained for monoenergetic neutrons. The spectra were normalized to Monte Carlo calculations of absolute differential efficiency by utilizing the proton-recoil plateau. The accuracy of the Monte Carlo calculation was verified in the region of the proton-recoil plateau by absolute experimental calibrations carried out at neutron energies of 2.66 and 14.43 MeV and by using a scintillator geometry more suitable for such tests.}

KamLAND-Zen 400 (383kg 136Xe used) released a lower limit on the 0ν2β half-life of 136Xe. However, the sensitivity is limited by the contamination of radioactive backgrounds from the inner-balloon. Then, we planned KamLAND-Zen 800, upgrading the detector with a new inner-balloon of 3.84m diameter with 800kg 136Xe and 31.4m3 liquid scintillator. We present the current status of KamLAND-Zen, the new mini-balloon construction and methods to avoid background contaminations.

Hydroxylation was found during thermo-oxidative degradation of both the titanium- and antinomy-containing PETs. However, more hydroxylated products were further changed into quinonoid species in the presence of titanium catalyst, which directly results in obviously enhanced coloration of the PET. It indicates that the PET synthesized with titanium-based catalysts is more susceptible to formation of quinonoid groups and discoloration than the PET prepared with ethylene glycol antimony."

It has been determined that the rate constant increases, while the activation energy decreases, linearly with increasing catalyst concentration within the range of 0–100ppm Sb. The SSP rate reaches its maximum value at about 150ppm Sb. The activation energies are 30.7 and 23.3kcal/mol respectively for the uncatalyzed and fully catalyzed SSP. The frequency factor decreases with increasing catalyst concentration due to the decreased mobility of catalyzed end groups. A mechanism of Sb catalysis has been proposed to explain these observations."

These analyses show that there is no credible UFTR accident that would result in major fuel damage or risk to public health and safety. The analysis was based on two limiting scenarios, whose extremity bound all other accidents of consequence: (1) the large step insertion of positive reactivity and (2) the release of fission products due to mechanical damage to a spent fuel plate. The maximum step insertion of positive reactivity was modeled using PARET/ANL software and shows a maximum peak fuel temperature of 283.2°C, which is significantly below the failure limit of 530°C. The exposure to the staff and general public was calculated for the worst-case fission product release scenario using the ORIGEN-S and COMPLY codes and was shown to be 6.5\% of the annual limit. Impacts on reactor operations and an Instrumentation & Control System (I&C) upgrade are discussed."

  abstract={Various scintillation devices are used in many countries and wide scientific fields. Key elements that determine the performance of a scintillation device are the number of photons emitted per incident radiation event and the emission of easy-to-measure blue photons. It is generally known that only materials with very complex compositions perform well as scintillators. However, we demonstrated that the scintillation performance of a newly developed plastic such as 100 percent pure polyethylene naphthalate exceeds that of conventional organic scintillators. By measuring the light output spectra and emission spectra of several samples, we revealed that the plastic emits a high number of photons per incident radiation event (~10500 photons/MeV), and, surprisingly, deep-blue photons (425 nm). Even though the plastic has a simple composition, it could replace the expensive organic scintillators that have been used in many applications.}

    abstract = {Abstract Copolyesters were synthesized from bis(hydroxyethyl) naphthalate/bis(hydroxymethylcyclohexane)naphthalate (BHEN/BHCN) with various compositions. Copolyesters having intrinsic viscosities of 0.58–0.65 dL g were obtained by melt polycondensation in the presence of metallic catalysts. The optimum condition for polyethylene-1,4-cyclohexanedimethylene naphthalate (PECN) copolyester manufacturing is the transesterification under a nitrogen atmosphere for 4 h at a temperature of 245 ± 5°C followed by polymerization under 2 mmHg for 50 min at a temperature of 290–320°C. Most copolyesters have better thermal stability than has poly(ethylene naphthalate) (PEN) and the effect of the cyclohexane–dimethylene structure on the thermal and crystalline properties of the resulting copolyesters was investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). Glass transition temperatures of the copolyesters were in the range of 115.2–138.4°C, and 10\% weight losses in nitrogen were all above 453°C. The solubility, crystallinity, and moisture absorption of the copolyesters were also investigated. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci 67:2245–2252, 1998}
